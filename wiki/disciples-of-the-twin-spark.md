The Dark Iron makes Sahaghast invaluable to Earth’s military-industrial complex, and to the greedy megacorporations, but it is the sweat and blood of honest miners that allow the extraction of the precious mineral. The work conditions are extremely harsh, the threat of Locusts ever-present, and the fair salary barely compensates all the risks.

Smaller protests and riots are commonplace across every colony, and Sahaghast was no exception. Nothing that Earth’s forces or the corporations’ private security forces could not handle. However, with the second wave of colonization came a rumor: somewhere, not far from Sahaghast, another mining colony had overthrown Earth’s grasp, and were now an independant planet. Better yet: these revolutionaries had conquered their entire star system and were now their own democratic nation.

In the beginning, Sahaghast miners passed this story to give themselves hope, nobody truly believing it. Over time, however, this rumor took a life of its own. Some said this sister-colony also had Dark Iron, and that their revolution’s success came from using it to fight against Earth. Other whispered that the military was busy fighting an external threat somewhere, and that the time to strike was now. 

Rumor became belief, belief became cult, and eventually a whole religion started about the proletariat’s destiny to use the Dark Iron to fight against oppression everywhere. Thus started the cult of the Twin Sparks - taking the name from the two colonies where Dark Iron was said to be found, one already free, one simply needing to revolt.

When the uprising began, it was uncoordinated. Some workers took over a small mine, declaring on all networks they’d use the Dark Iron for liberty and progress from now on, and calling all their brothers and sisters to join them. This caused revolts in nearly every single settlement, stretching Earth’s security forces and private militaries to their limits. Seeing the situation was out of control, the Conglomerate’s leadership turned to using every single weapon in their arsenal to crush the rebellion. Millions died, and Sahaghast’s population was brought to heel.

The third colonization wave brought more workers to replace the losses, but also a lot more security forces - both Enlisted and from the Corporations. This crackdown quieted the disgruntled population and for a while it seemed that this would be the end of the Twin Sparks. That was, until the Tech arrived.

The machine invasion almost brought Sahaghast low. Only the combined resistance of all human forces allowed to barely defeat this Tech invasion fleet. The machine deployed jammers near the end of the war that prevented long-range communications across the surface, causing chaos and logistical issues during the post-war reconstruction, but also offered new opportunities for freedom-loving workers.

With the lack of capacity to retaliate from Earth’s government, who had transformed into the Iron Star, most mining cities realized that independence was within reach. The new vassal system implemented by the Iron Keep, as well as the threat of Crimson raiders or Tech remnants, made it so not many cities took their chance - until one lead the way.

The largest mining city on Sahaghast, after the planetary capital, was very far from the grip of Iron Command, but was kept in check by the largest military base of the Iron Star, with their largest artillery guns in range of the outskirts of town without even leaving their hangars.

Preachers of the Twin Sparks religion were particularly active in this city, but when they announced that the end of the war was the perfect time to take control of their destinies, and that the workforce would understand the sign when they’d see it, nobody took them seriously - neither the peacekeeping forces, nor the miners.

When the ‘sign’ happened, it was not subtle. A derelict Tech ship, crippled during the war, got finally caught by gravity and plunged towards the planet. It crashed directly on the mining-city’s military garrison in the morning, under the eyes of the teeming mass of miners about to go to work. The impact caused severe damage in the city’s outskirts, but more importantly, it annihilated the only military presence large enough to keep the population under control.

When the first scouts reported that indeed the Iron Star garrison was gone, and that the Tech ship was entirely disabled, the miners took no chance and lost no time in overthrowing their oppressors, under the guidance of the Twin Sparks preachers - to whom everyone was now listening to.

The Iron Keep was far away, but never would Iron Command let the massive city go free without a fight. A gigantic war convoy was sent from the Iron Keep to take back control of the metropolis.

With little time to prepare, and no access to military equipment, the now-free population turned once again to the preachers. They explained that the crash of the Tech ship was an obvious sign that their sister-colony sent aid, and that this ship would bring their salvation.

The miners tried to salvage what they could, and by divine providence or blind luck, they indeed found how not only to protect their city, but also to push back the Iron Star. By miracle, some of the weapon systems of the ship could be reactivated, and the barrage of micro-missiles and plasma cannons obliterated the Iron vanguard and forced the rest of the war convoy to turn around.

The citizens of the independent city renamed their town as « Freestar Hold », in reference to their salvation from the sky - and by opposition to Iron Command. Even better yet, the large Tech ship had a hoard of Tech Cores that had not yet been programmed with absolute combat protocols.

With extreme care and a lot of trial-and-error, the people of Freestar Hold managed to reactivate some of the free-willed Tech Cores, and purpose-built them large mechanical bodies so they could live their own free lives – and of course, help their human saviors. These large new robotics entities called themselves the Reclaimed and found immediate purpose in the defense of Freestar Hold alongside the rebel miners, and in return, the humans offered to go beyond the grudges of the past and accept the Reclaimed into their free society.

This shining example of a bright future inspired many cities, and in the near vicinity of Freestar Hold, a dozen outposts and cities of various sizes joined the uprising. The combined forces of Freestar and their Reclaimed, and the long-range firepower of the crashed Tech ship, allow this bubble of freedom to persist, despite the best efforts of the Children of the Iron Star.

Luckily for Iron Command, the hazy communications across the surface - most of which are still controlled the Iron Keep- mean that word of this rebellion has not gotten out to the larger population of Sahaghast beyond the occasional rumor. 

The preachers of the Twin Sparks, however, are adamant: this is but the first step of the larger uprising, which will allow Sahaghast to become its own independent democratic nation and join the mythical sister-colony in a fight to spread liberty across the cosmos; to organics and robotics alike.

For now, Freestar Hold leads the effort to make every mining city free from the grip of Iron Command, or from the threat of the Order of the Crimson Moon. Many expeditions are sent, sometimes only of armed miners, sometimes only of Reclaimed, and sometimes a mix of both. 
The forces, cities and motivations of these freedom fighters are extremely varied, going from a nearly anarchic fight against all authorities, to a pure desire of freedom and democracy, up to a religious fervor of converting more and more to the Twin Sparks cult. All these forces are united against their common enemies, but who knows how it would go if -by miracle- they would succeed in overthrowing their chains and taking full control of Sahaghast.
