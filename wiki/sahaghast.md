[Below is a short summary of Sahaghast, WiP, feel free dear reader to add more info and appropriate this lore!]

The planet Sahaghast, in the Luyten System, was colonized despite harsh conditions because of a rare mineral nicknamed by the first settlers "_Dark Iron_"

The equator is a large volcanic chain/belt, and the poles are unbearably cold. Both areas are inhabited by local alien insectoid lifeforms that feed on Dark Iron.

Between these two areas, most of the planet is covered by a wasteland/desert. This is where all the large settlements are. Luckily for the humans, Dark Iron deposits are always near the clean water sources (maybe there is a connexion?). 
Thus nearly all the mining settlements (which go from small outposts to massive cities) are autonomous - since they can also grow their own crops.

The first colonization wave brought pioneers, explorers and scientists. They struggled against the local lifeform, which they nicknamed « Locusts », and whose overwhelming numbers in both equator and poles rendered these already inhospitable regions absolutely unreachable.

The second wave, now knowing of the Dark Iron potential, brought two-hundred times as many colonists, as many factions wanted their piece of this new gold. Untold number of miners flood the planet under the supervision of all-powerful conglomerates, while Earth’s grasp is tightened by the installation of one of the largest military garrison outside of the core worlds.

Furthermore, some elite Rigs pilots, aboard their prototype war mechs, were hired by the mega-corporation to hunt down the largest Locust organisms, which always nestled near the richest Dark Iron deposits.

For a while, Saharghast prospered, until words of another colony achieving independence through revolution started to bloom. It was just a rumor at first, but eventually turned into full-blown riots.

The strong military force was there for this specific purpose, and the revolts was brought in blood. The third colonization wave brought a lot more military forces, both from Earth and from the corporations, and yet even more of miners and industrialists. 

However the gold rush was to end, as merely a year after the arrival of the third wave, the Tech arrived. Being one of the outermost planets of Earth territories, Saharghast was struck without warning. Many of the other barely-colonized planets in the system fell quickly, and the invading robotic armies brought war to Saharghast herself.

The conflict lasted for many years - and brought every faction to their knees. The only safe place on the planet was the colonists’ capital, under the protection of the Iron Keep ground citadel in the middle of the city, and the Crimson Moon orbital station in geosynchronous orbit above.

The details of the war are blurry, mostly legends by this point as the heroic actions described couldn’t have actually happened realistically. All that is known for sure is that Earth’s entire fleet in-system was destroyed and most orbital installations wiped out. 
Worst: at the height of the war, to try to turn the tide, the Tech deployed a series of jammers across the globe that burrowed deep beneath the surface, emitting particles that prevent long-range communications.

Isolated, broken, the human forces started to fight each other for survival and supremacy.

The [Children of the Iron Star](children-of-the-iron-star) is the main organized faction, oppressing all others under its fist. This military autocracy was born from the remnants of Earth’s military force on Sahaghast, and considers its holy duty to unite what is left of humanity to fight against the Tech.

The [Order of the Iron Moon](order-of-the-iron-moon) fights against the Iron Star - but they are at best another oppressive feudal power, at worst a band of roving raiders. At first the Crimson Moon was controlled by the mega corporations, but over time the warmech pilot took more and more importance, as the Conglomerate Security Forces were thinned down by the wars. Over time they both fused with one another, with a nobility system where each high-ranking Warmech pilot owns a small private force, and fight against other lords for resources, glory and social status.

Between the oppressive military superpower and the pseudo-noble ultra-capitalists, are all the semi-indépendant mining cities. Most of them are vassals of the Iron Star, few are under the protection of the Crimson Moon, and fewer even are truly independent. The sizes vary a lot, and those that have a patron power also have a garrison making sure of their loyalty when the communications are down. Every single one also has its own militias, poorly equipped but determined workers-turned-fighters. The indépendant mining-cities even have massive reconverted extraction vehicles to keep the Iron Star and the Crimson Moon at bay.

Finally, the largest mining city freed itself from the Iron Star when a derelict Tech ship crashed on the nearby military garrison. 
Since then, the * [Disciples of the Twin Spark](disciples-of-the-twin-spark) are a semi-religious force of freedom fighters, resisting oppression and trying to liberate their mining brothers. 
They turned the disconnected Tech forces from inside the derelict ship against the Iron Star forces, and now the Twin Sparks is composed of both miners militias as well as Reclaimed Tech heavy infantry.

On top of these three main players (Iron Star / Crimson Moon / Twin Sparks) there are lots of smaller indépendant factions. Smaller cities that stole Iron Star equipment and vehicles. Crimson Lords that were exiled with their troops, and now have a small outpost/town on the surface. Anarchists and bandits roving the deserts, rebels from the Iron Star that decided to start their own empire of tyranny, bands of zealot hunters that hunt the Tech remnants in the deep desert, Dark Iron hunters that drill near the largest Locust hives to get the purest mineral, etc…
