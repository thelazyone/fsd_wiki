The direct descendants of Earth’s military forces on Sahaghast, the Iron Star is the largest, most powerful organization left on the planet following the Tech invasion.

Originally built to repress any desire of revolt from the teeming masses of miners, or from greedy megacorporations, these soldiers and administrators have one purpose : to unite humankind, and fight back the Tech.

Over time, as the war intensified and losses grew, they went from a classical colonialist force into a quasi-zealous military dictatorship, who considers its holy duty to lead the fight of organics against machines.

The deployment of particle jammers across the planet by Tech forces hit Iron Star the hardest, as its territories are vast and its many vassal-cities are too long for direct communication… or control.

For this reason, the Iron Star installed a series of communication towers across the desert to serve as relays to reach each mining-city that swore an oath of loyalty to the Iron Keep (the massive citadel at the heart of the planetary capital).

To serve as a first line of defense against external attacks or internal dissidence, powerful garrisons have been installed in immediate proximity to all Iron-controlled cities. Officially, they are there to protect against bandits, Tech remnants and Crimson raiding parties. In truth, their main purpose is to keep the cities in check, and make sure they send their tributes to the Keep.

This tribute is threefold: Dark Iron, water, and food. This constant influx of raw resources allowed the Capital to grow as the largest metropolis - by far - on the planet.

The frequent sandstorms, and the ever-present risk of the Crimson Moon interceptors, make the trips between the vassal-cities and the capital a huge risk by the air. Thus, ground wheeled convoys are the lifeblood that allow the capital to keep growing and thriving.

These convoys go from small (a dozen trucks, a few escorting support tanks and a couple of infantry-carrying IFVs) to truly gargantuan. The threat of Crimson raiding parties is every-present, and only the massive convoys accompanied by one of the three last remaining Land Citadels are really safe.

Of course the lack of communication means that many Iron garrison commanders can be tempted to start their own little empire, away from the grip of the capital’s high council known as Iron Command. Since many outposts are self-sufficient, and Iron Command’s resources are thinly stretched, some commanders believe the benefits to outweigh the risk. The further they are from the Iron Keep, the less chances that a punitive army will be sent to bring them back into the fold… but it also means they will be left to fend for themselves if Crimson raiders, Tech remnants, or Locust hordes decide to attack them.
